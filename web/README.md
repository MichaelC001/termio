# termio web

The marketing site for **termio** — a native macOS (Apple Silicon) terminal for
AI coding agents. termio is **free to use**: no account, no license keys, no
payment backend. This folder is just the public site; the desktop app itself
lives in the repository root (`Sources/termio`).

## Sub-projects

- **[`landing/`](./landing)** — the marketing site. Next.js + TypeScript +
  Tailwind + shadcn/ui, with a visual design modeled on superwhisper.com. Tells
  the product story and links straight to the Mac download.

## Distribution

The app is downloaded directly as a notarized `.dmg` (the stable Cloudflare R2
URL behind `downloads.termio.sh`, served via `landing/src/lib/site.ts`) and keeps
itself current through built-in **Sparkle** auto-updates. There is no checkout,
no licensing service, and no server to run.

> Source will be opened later — not yet.

## Docs

- **[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — what the `web/` project
  is and how the landing site is built and deployed.

## Quickstart

The site sets up from its own README: work in [`landing/`](./landing)
(`npm install && npm run dev`).
