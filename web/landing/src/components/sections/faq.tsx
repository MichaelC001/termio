  {
    question: "Is Termio free?",
    answer: "Yes. Termio is free and open source. No account, no cloud.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What happens to a running agent when I quit Termio or close the laptop?",
    answer:
      "Sessions are hosted by termiod, not the app window. Quit Termio, sleep the laptop, or reboot — the agent keeps running. Reattach restores the exact screen.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run agents on a remote machine?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Any Linux VPS you can ssh to — Termio reads ~/.ssh/config and never rewrites it. Set Up copies one binary over SSH, starts the daemon, and installs the agents’ hooks there. Local and remote sessions run through the same host.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from Zed remote or VS Code Remote?",
    answer:
      "The session lives on the machine, not in the connection. Drop the link and the agent keeps running; reattach restores the exact screen. Zed Remote and VS Code Remote keep remote work inside a live connection.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from tmux?",
    answer:
      "tmux is a prefix-key multiplexer you attach a terminal to. Termio is a native Mac app with its own session host — same sessions on this Mac, a remote box, or the iPhone companion. You don’t have to learn tmux. There is no prefix key to remember.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which agents are supported?",
    answer: `${supportedAgents.join(", ")}, and any other coding agent that runs in a terminal. Each session is a real terminal, not a chat view.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How does Termio know when an agent needs me?",
    answer:
      "Agents report working, needs you and done through hooks Termio installs. If a hook isn’t there, Termio reads the screen.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my code private?",
    answer:
      "Yes. No account, no cloud, no telemetry. Code never leaves machines you own.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Termio a fork of Ghostty?",
    answer: "No. Termio is built on libghostty. It is not a fork.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an iPhone app?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A free iPhone companion mirrors sessions live; it’s in TestFlight beta. Remote access uses a tunnel you choose — Tunelo, Cloudflare, ngrok, or a self-hosted relay.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I script it?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The termio CLI drives the running app over a local socket, and ships as an agent skill.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the requirements?",
    answer:
      "macOS 14 or later. Universal binary, so the same download runs on Apple silicon and Intel. You bring the agent CLIs and their credentials.",
  },
