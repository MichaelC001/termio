// Shared site constants. Termio is free to use and ships with Sparkle
// auto-updates — no account, no license keys, no payment backend.

// The agents Termio ships a manifest for, in the order the app itself lists
// them (`Sources/termio/Resources/agents/*.json`, the `order` field). The hero
// marquee and the FAQ answer read this list; the agent showcase draws a panel
// for the subset of it we have a capture of, and its names are checked against
// this type so the two can't drift apart again. The app bundles a few more
// manifests than this — an agent joins the list once it has a brand mark and
// someone has run it.
