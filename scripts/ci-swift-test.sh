# Run `swift test` under a watchdog that samples a hang instead of waiting it out.
#
# A test that never returns used to take the whole job with it: the runner's
# job cap force-cancels the run, and GitHub keeps no log for a cancelled job,
# so the one fact worth having — which test never returned, and what its
# threads were doing — is gone. That is how the Intel leg of the macOS
# workflow burned 30 minutes on the ghostty 1.0.25 merge and left nothing to
# read (run 34820337118).
#
# So bound the run here, below the job cap: when the deadline passes, sample
# the test processes, print the stacks into the job log, and kill them. The
# step then fails normally, which is what keeps the log.
