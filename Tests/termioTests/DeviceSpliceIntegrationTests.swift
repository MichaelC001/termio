/// The unit tests next door cover what the token comparison accepts. They say
/// nothing about the part a phone actually depends on — that the listener
/// answers 101 for a real token, refuses one it does not know, and then copies
/// a stream whose message boundaries mean nothing. That is three moving pieces
/// (a `NWListener`, a WebSocket handshake handler, two chained pumps) and none
/// of them fails at compile time.
///
/// No `termiod` is involved: the server is handed a `DaemonSocket` naming a
/// Unix socket this test serves itself, so nothing here reaches the real
/// daemon, writes a pairing token into its state directory, or starts one.
