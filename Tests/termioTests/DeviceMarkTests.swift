/// a mark follows the *machine*, not the road taken to it. Keyed by alias, one
/// box reached over a LAN name, a WAN name and a tailnet name would carry three
/// different marks — worse than no mark at all, because the cue would then be
/// actively misleading.
///
/// It used to be pinned about a hue. The hue is gone (a workspace belongs to one
/// machine, so it was the same colour repeated down the column); the identity
/// rule it protected is not, because the mark now has to decide whether a row's
/// device *is* the device being shown before it may claim to know anything live
/// about it.
