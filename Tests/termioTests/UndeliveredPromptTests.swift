/// A spawned prompt that was written but never received.
///
/// `performDelivery` answers whether bytes could be *written* to a surface,
/// which is weaker than it reads. An agent still on a startup gate — a
/// hook-trust prompt, a usage notice, a first-run dialog — consumes typed text
/// as the answer to its own question and shows nothing for it. The write
/// succeeds, the prompt is gone, and `spawn` has already replied with an
/// address.
///
/// That gate also defeats the readiness check that precedes typing, whose test
/// is two identical frames: a program waiting for a keypress is perfectly
/// still. So this cannot be prevented before the fact, only reported after it,
/// and `sessions list` is where a caller who already has its reply can find out.
