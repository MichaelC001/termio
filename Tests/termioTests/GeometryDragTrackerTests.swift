/// The gate that decides whether a viewport declaration streams or debounces.
///
/// Worth pinning because both of its failure modes are silent. A drag that
/// never reports leaves the session reflowing only after the user lets go —
/// the bug this tracker was widened to fix, which shipped unnoticed for as
/// long as a window edge was the only drag AppKit announced. An end that never
/// arrives is worse and quieter: `isActive` stays true forever, every later
/// declaration takes the streaming cadence, and the 400ms debounce stops
/// protecting the app's own layout animations from declaring a size nobody
/// chose. Neither shows up as a crash or a failed build.
