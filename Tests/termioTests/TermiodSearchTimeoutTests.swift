/// What a search does when the device accepts it and then says nothing.
///
/// This is not a hypothetical: unknown control operations are *dropped* by the
/// daemon rather than refused (`daemon.rs`, the `Control::Unknown` arm), so a
/// host that predates `fs.search` answers a search with silence on an open,
/// healthy connection. Without a bound the client parks a thread, a socket, and
/// on the SSH road a child process, for the life of the app.
///
/// The stub is a plain listening socket that completes the handshake and then
/// holds its end open — the one host that cannot be built out of a real daemon,
/// because a real daemon always answers.
