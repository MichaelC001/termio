/// What a resize's keyframe is allowed to do to the screen.
///
/// The daemon opens its snapshot barrier before it emits `E resized`, and defers
/// events behind an open barrier, so `S` always reaches a client ahead of the
/// message that tells it what size to become. Every rule below follows from
/// that: a keyframe that arrives early must wait, everything behind it must wait
/// with it and in order, and the wait must end — on the grid, on a flood, or on
/// a deadline. Only the first of those three endings paints it: a keyframe drawn
/// for a grid the surface is not laid out at scrambles every row it touches, so
/// the other two drop it and ask for a resync. A wrong answer here shows up as a
/// terminal that paints twice per resize, one that goes quiet, or — the report
/// this was written from — one that scrambles for a round trip on every drag.
