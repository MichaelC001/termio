// MouseOverLink as the hovered link changes — even inside a mouse-capturing TUI, where it declines
// to draw its own underline but still tells us the URL. We use that both to swap in the pointing-hand
// cursor (the VS Code feel) and to remember the hovered URL so the cmd-click interceptor can open it.

/// ghostty won't fire its own `open_url`. There is only one mouse, so this is a single main-actor
