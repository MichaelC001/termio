/// A password for an SSH host, kept in the login Keychain and handed to the
/// system `ssh` through the one channel OpenSSH itself provides for it.
///
/// **Why this shape.** ssh_config has no directive that holds a password, and
/// termio never links an SSH library, so the password cannot travel with the
/// host block or through a client we control. What OpenSSH does offer is
/// `SSH_ASKPASS`: a program it runs when it needs a secret, reading the answer
/// off that program's stdout. `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` (OpenSSH 8.4+) makes it
/// use that program even when a terminal is present, which is what lets a session
/// with a real PTY skip the prompt.
///
/// **Where the secret is, and is not.** It is in the Keychain and nowhere else.
/// The askpass helper is a two-line script that asks `security(1)` for it at the
/// moment ssh asks, so the password is never in an argument list (`sshpass`'s
/// flaw — argv is world-readable through `ps`), never in the environment, and
/// never written to a file. termio itself doesn't read it back; only the helper
/// does, and only when ssh runs it.
///
/// **The trust boundary, stated plainly.** Writing through `security(1)` leaves an
/// item whose access list trusts `security(1)`, so any process running as this
/// user can read it back without a prompt. That is the same standing any process
/// has over an `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain` passphrase, and it is the cost of
/// letting the system ssh binary — rather than an embedded client — do the
/// authenticating. A password is offered here because the user asked for one; a
/// key remains the better credential and the only one the daemon paths can use
/// without giving up `BatchMode`.
