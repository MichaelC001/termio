/// given day.
///
/// Deliberately **not** PostHog's Swift SDK. `posthog-ios` ships
/// `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` as a bundled resource in two of its targets and pulls
/// in PLCrashReporter and libwebp behind it — an SPM dependency that ships
/// resources is the exact shape that has crashed a released termio twice (see
/// AGENTS.md, "Dependencies and vendored code"). PostHog's capture endpoint is
/// one JSON POST, and a daily-active count needs nothing else, so the whole
/// integration is this file: no session replay, no autocapture, no crash
/// reporter, no background queue.
///
/// What leaves the machine, at most once per calendar day: a random install
/// UUID, the app version, the macOS version, and the preferred language. No
/// project paths, no session contents, no account, nothing tied to a person.
/// Events are sent anonymously (`$process_person_profile: false`), so PostHog
/// stores no person record — daily-unique counts resolve on the install id
/// alone.
///
/// Off in the dev channel, off under `swift run` and `swift test`, and off
/// entirely when the user turns it off in Settings ▸ General ▸ Privacy.
