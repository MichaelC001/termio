/// Right column. Every session that has been opened stays *mounted* here for the
/// app's lifetime; switching sessions only flips opacity and keyboard focus.
///
/// The earlier design swapped the visible terminal with `.id(session.id)`, which
/// made SwiftUI destroy the old surface view and build a fresh one on every
/// switch. A fresh `TerminalView` lays out from a zero frame, so libghostty calls
/// `ghostty_surface_set_size` — a SIGWINCH the shell answers by repainting its
/// prompt. That resize-on-every-switch was the visible flicker. Keeping each
/// surface mounted and only toggling visibility means the view is never
/// reparented or resized, so the shell never repaints and switching is instant.
