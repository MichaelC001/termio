# Vendored Highlightr

Vendored from [raspu/Highlightr](https://github.com/raspu/Highlightr) 2.3.x
(five classes + `highlight.min.js` + the two xcode theme CSS files, which live
in `../../Resources/` and ship inside `termio_termio.bundle`).

Why vendored instead of a package dependency: with plain `swift build`, SwiftPM
generates every dependency's `Bundle.module` accessor with exactly two
candidate paths — the `.app` **root** (where codesign forbids bundles) and a
**hardcoded absolute path on the build machine**. A CI-built release therefore
finds neither and `fatalError`s the moment `Highlightr.init` runs (the v0.2.4
open-a-file crash). Vendoring routes resource lookups through
`Bundle.termioResources` instead, the same sign-safe shim the brand icons use.

Local changes are listed in the header of `Highlightr.swift`; everything else
is verbatim upstream.
