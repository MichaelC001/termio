/// Keeps a live branch label for checkouts on other machines — `BranchModel`'s
/// device-side twin, with the read and the watch relocated across the wire. The
/// daemon rides the workspace watch it already runs and re-reads `HEAD`
/// in-process (`termiod/src/git.rs` `read_head`, the `head:` resource), so a
/// `git checkout` on the box updates the label here the way a local one does —
/// without the per-event `git status` the Changes pane's `git:` subscription
/// costs, which is what makes it affordable while the checkout is merely on
/// screen.
///
/// Batches are full state, never deltas: applying one is a replacement. A box
/// without a daemon, or with one too old to know `head:`, simply never answers,
/// and the label stays hidden — exactly what those sessions showed before.
///
/// Identity is the checkout — the machine *and* the root — because a remote
/// path can spell exactly like a local one (`~/repo` here and on the box), and
/// a label keyed by bare path would show one machine's branch beside the
/// other's name.
