//! What a resize does to a full-screen TUI's canvas, as opposed to flowing text.
//!
//! The resize policy was chosen by asking what the foreground process was
//! called: a shell got a truncating resize to protect its prompt redisplay,
//! everything else got rewrapped, on the reasoning that "an agent TUI, an
//! editor, a pager all repaint from their own model". These tests exist because
//! that reasoning is wrong. Repainting from your own model *is* width-relative
//! arithmetic the moment you walk the cursor back over the rows you drew, and
//! every full-screen TUI does exactly that.
