//! A snapshot payload must leave a replaying client on the *same* screen as
//! the host — including the scroll position. The formatter paints a scrolled
//! primary screen as one newline-joined flow that stops at the last non-blank
//! row, so without compensation the client ends up a scroll step behind the
//! host, the trailing cursor re-assert lands on the last painted line, and the
//! first live byte after the seam overwrites that line. That was the reattach
//! bug: quit the app mid-stream, reopen it, and the line written in the attach
//! second vanished from the screen.
