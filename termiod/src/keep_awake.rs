//! Hold the machine out of idle sleep while stopping the daemon would take
//! work from someone.
//!
//! The failure this exists for: an agent prints a permission prompt and goes
//! quiet. While it was streaming, its pty counted as an active tty and
//! `pmset`'s default `ttyskeepawake` kept the machine up for free; the moment
//! it stops to wait, that cover lapses, the idle-sleep timer runs out, and the
//! phone that was supposed to answer the prompt can no longer reach the box.
//! The predicate is therefore [`SessionSummary::busy`] — the same "would
//! stopping take work" test the update path uses — not "is anyone attached";
//! see that method for why attachment is deliberately not the test.
//!
//! The assertion is a lease, not a held lock. While any session is busy, a
//! short-lived `caffeinate -i -s -t LEASE` child is renewed on a timer; when
//! nothing is busy the last lease simply runs out, which is also the grace
//! period. Nothing is ever released, so every exit path is covered by the same
//! non-mechanism: a crash, `termiod stop`, and the `execve` handoff (which
//! runs no destructors and would orphan any long-lived child this module kept)
//! all leave at most one lease that expires on its own. `-i` limits the
//! assertion to idle system sleep — the display still sleeps.
//!
//! On battery no lease is taken at all. That has to be this module's own
//! check (`pmset -g batt` before each renewal): caffeinate's `-i` assertion
//! is honored on battery power, and `-s` does not scope it to AC — it only
//! adds a second, AC-only assertion. Unplugging mid-lease costs at most one
//! [`LEASE`] of battery-powered wakefulness.
