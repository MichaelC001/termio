//! Who is running in the session's terminal, and where.
//!
//! This answers "which agent is in there" — a question whose answer changes
//! when a human starts or stops a program, not per frame. It knows nothing
//! about clients, snapshots or the protocol; it needs a tty and a child pid,
//! and everything else it learns from the kernel.
//!
//! Split deliberately along what each half costs. `tcgetpgrp` is one syscall
//! and runs on the session actor; reading argv is a `KERN_PROCARGS2` sysctl on
//! macOS and a file read on Linux, and finding *which* pid to read it for can
//! mean walking every process on the box when a pipeline's leader has exited.
//! None of that may happen on the actor: that task also runs the PTY read and
//! the fan-out, so a process-table walk there is time the byte path spends
//! waiting — the anti-100× invariant, which is about more than the VT parse.
