//! Who is actually running in a session's terminal.
//!
//! A session's `command` is what it was *created* with. That answers nothing
//! once a login shell has been sitting there for an hour: the program the user
//! is talking to is whatever holds the tty's foreground process group, and the
//! directory that matters is wherever the child `cd`'d to since. The kernel
//! knows both; nothing in the byte stream does.
//!
//! termio's macOS app reads this with `KERN_PROCARGS2` + `proc_pidinfo`
//! (`Sources/termio/Terminal/Ghostty/PTYProcess.swift`), which is why it has
//! never worked for a Linux host. The same questions have plain answers under
//! `/proc`, so this module asks them behind one interface and lets the target
//! pick the mechanism.
//!
//! What is *not* per-target is the shape of the answer. `tcgetpgrp` names a
//! process group and every argv lookup wants a pid, and the two only agree
//! while the group leader is alive. Both hosts therefore enumerate the group
//! and pick a live member — `proc_listpgrppids` on macOS, a `/proc` walk on
//! Linux — through one selection rule below.
//!
//! Every function here is a syscall against a pid, so three rules hold at every
//! call site:
//!
//! 1. **Never on the byte path.** Sampling is a poll, bounded and infrequent;
//!    PTY delivery must not wait on it (the anti-100× invariant). The session
//!    actor dispatches this work to a blocking thread for exactly that reason.
//! 2. **Never after the child is reaped.** A recycled pid answers confidently
//!    about a process that is not ours.
//! 3. **Never trust a pid without its group.** Every candidate is checked
//!    against the group it was asked about, because rule 2's recycled pid is
//!    reachable through a stale group id too.
//!
//! Failure is always `None`. A refusal by the kernel, a process that exited
//! mid-read, a short buffer — none of them are worth an error type, because
//! every caller does the same thing with all of them: keep the last known
//! answer and try again next tick.
