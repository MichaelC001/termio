//! The host's identities.
//!
//! A client id, a session id and a session name were all `String`, and they all
//! flow through the same functions: a client id keys a session's roster, a
//! session id keys the session table and the graveyard, and a user-supplied
//! target — which may be an id *or* a name — arrives from the wire looking
//! exactly like both. Nothing but the type told them apart, so the type is what
//! tells them apart.
//!
//! These are host-side only. The wire keeps bare JSON strings, because that is
//! what a JSON string is: `SessionInfo.id` and `Control::HelloOk.client_id` stay
//! `String`, and every crossing into or out of them is a visible `new` or
//! `to_string`. Swift sees no difference.
