//! termio — the command a person types. `termiod` is the daemon, like
//! `dockerd`; this client drives the Mac app and the session host
//! (docker-lessons RFC §1).
//!
//! Argument parsing is clap, like `termiod`'s. The hand-rolled dispatcher
//! this replaces was a faithful port of `scripts/termio`, and it inherited
//! the shell client's two parsing defects: a `case` that matched exact flag
//! strings swallowed any unrecognized `--flag` into the payload (so
//! `spawn "hi" --agnet codex` ran on the default agent, silently, exit 0),
//! and `--flag=value` was never a form it understood. Both are structural in
//! clap. A payload that genuinely starts with `--` stays expressible after
//! the `--` separator.
//!
//! What clap could not express stays hand-rolled, in the dispatch below
//! rather than the parser: `termio [DIR]` treats any non-verb first argument
//! as a directory (the `code .` shape, an `external_subcommand`), `--host`
//! re-runs the typed words on another machine, and `send`'s first positional
//! is a target only if it looks like an address.
//!
//! The per-verb prose is the shell client's, verbatim, carried as clap
//! `long_about`. `termiod/tests/cli_compat.py` still holds the wire bytes,
//! the exit codes and the JSON shapes against the shell client; it no longer
//! diffs help text or error wording, which are this client's own.

const NOTIFY_HELP: &str = "\
Post a macOS notification from the running app, such as \"build finished\" or
\"need a decision\", whether or not Termio is in front. --title replaces the
default title, the calling agent's name. Clicking the banner shows the session
that posted it.";

const SIM_HELP: &str = "\
Drive the iOS Simulator shown in termio's Simulator pane, so an agent can run
and check an iOS app the way the person watching would. Coordinates are device
points from the top-left of the screen as it is shown — after a rotation too —
the unit `inspect` reports frames in, so tap the centre of a frame it printed.
Read the screen with `inspect` before tapping anything you have not located;
use `screenshot` for colour, images and layout.

Run `attach` FIRST, before you build: the person watches from the first
frame, and a shut-down device boots while xcodebuild compiles. It answers as
soon as the device is drawing — a few seconds — not once it has booted; the
next command waits for the boot to finish (half a minute, minutes on a first
boot), so start the build in between.

  termio sim attach --device \"iPhone 17\"
  xcodebuild -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \\
    -derivedDataPath build build
  termio sim launch build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/MyApp.app
  termio sim inspect
  termio sim tap --label \"Continue\"
  termio sim swipe 200 700 200 200
  termio sim text \"hello@example.com\" && termio sim key return
  termio sim screenshot --out /tmp/screen.png

With no --device, a command uses the first of these that is booted: the device
this session used last; the device the pane shows, unless another session is
driving it; a device no other session is driving; any device. When nothing is
booted, name one with `attach --device`. Build with xcodebuild in your shell;
`logs` reads the app's log and `crash-report` its last crash.
Needs a Mac with Apple silicon and macOS 15 or later.";

const SIM_INSPECT_HELP: &str = "\
Print the frontmost app's accessibility tree, one element per line:
type, label, value (or an empty field's placeholder), identifier, then the
frame as x,y width x height in device points. Elements that say nothing are
folded away, and elements wholly off the screen are counted, not printed.
With X Y, print the element drawn at that point, as a tap there would find
it — the read that resolves what covers what.
With --marker, print the first element, in tree order, whose label (or
--match value, role or id) contains the text; a title can match before the
button that shares it, so check the type. When the reply names a modal, stay
inside it. --json prints idb's full accessibility document instead.";

const SESSION_HELP: &str = "\
List, start, drive and close sessions.

With the Termio app running, these commands act on the sessions of the
project you run them in. With no app running, they act on this machine's
termiod. `create`, `attach` and `ls --all` always act on termiod, and so
does `read` of a session the app opened.
`termio -H <host> session …` acts on another machine.

A SESSION is a termio://session/<id> link, an id, an id prefix of 8 or more
characters, or a name. `ls` and a `spawn` reply print them. With the app
running, `send` reads a first word that is not a link or id as prompt text.

A command waits up to $TERMIO_CLI_TIMEOUT seconds (default 15) for the app.";

  termio -H mybox session ls";

const LIST_HELP: &str = "\
List this project's sessions and their status: working, idle, done or

--all lists every session this machine's termiod hosts instead, in every

const WATCH_HELP: &str = "\
Print one line each time a session's status changes, until Ctrl-C. It starts
with one line per session; --no-snapshot skips them.

--state picks the states to print, from working, idle, done, needs-you and
stalled (default: done,needs-you). `stalled` means working for 20 minutes or
more with no repository change and almost no transcript growth; the line says
why. In --json, a {\"heartbeat\":true} line follows 30 seconds of silence.

Examples:

const SPAWN_HELP: &str = "\
Start a new agent session on PROMPT, in a pane beside yours. The reply is the
session's link. The prompt is typed in once the agent has started.

--agent picks the agent (default: the kind that calls). --direction and --ratio
place the pane. --wait returns when the agent's first turn settles.

An agent that stops on a startup prompt, such as a trust prompt, takes PROMPT
as its answer. `session ls --json` then flags it as prompt_undelivered; send
the prompt again with `session send`.

Needs the Termio app. Exit codes: 0 done, 1 error, 3 timed out.";

Start a new terminal session and run COMMAND in it, such as a dev server or a
test run. The reply is the session's link. A plain command has no transcript;
`session read` prints its screen.

--direction and --ratio place the pane: `--direction down --ratio 0.25` is a
strip under yours. --wait returns when the screen stops changing.

Start a session on termiod that no app window shows, and print its id. It runs
PROGRAM, or your login shell, until it exits or you close it. Attach to it

Attach this terminal to a session on termiod. Detach with Ctrl-\\; the session
keeps running. A name that matches no session creates one with that name.

Examples:
  termio session attach build
  termio session attach 8de0b387 --observe
  termio -H mybox session attach api";

const READ_HELP: &str = "\
Print a session's screen, without the scrollback, and leave the session where
it is. --lines keeps the last N rows. It is how you read a `run` session's
result, or check on an agent.";

const READ_EXAMPLES: &str = "\
Examples:
  termio session read 8de0b387
  termio session read build --lines 20";

const SEND_HELP: &str = "\
Type text into a session, then press Return: a prompt, or an answer such as
\"1\" or \"yes\". Without a SESSION, `send` starts a new agent, like `spawn`.

--no-enter types the text and no Return: the lone `t` a trust prompt waits
for.

--key presses a named key after the text, in the order given, and drops the
Return; add `--key enter` for one. Names: enter escape tab space backspace
delete insert up down left right home end pageup pagedown f1-f12, a single
character, and ctrl- or shift- chords (ctrl-c, shift-tab). Option and Command
chords are refused. For a meta chord, send `--key escape --key b`.

--wait returns when the turn the text started settles. The reply carries the
status, the transcript path and the line range of the answer.

--key and --wait need the Termio app. Exit codes: 0 done, 1 error, including
a stalled or closed session, 3 timed out.";
