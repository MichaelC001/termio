//! Where the daemon's own diagnostics go.
//!
//! `termiod serve` is normally started by the Mac app with stdio on `/dev/null`
//! (`TermiodClient.spawnDaemon`) or by launchd, whose plist names no
//! `StandardErrorPath`. Both discard stderr, so every `eprintln!` in the daemon —
//! and every panic message, since the release profile aborts — was unrecoverable
//! after the fact. A user reporting "termio froze" could hand over the app's
//! unified-log trail and nothing whatsoever from the process that owns the PTYs.
//!
//! The fix works at the file-descriptor level rather than by rewriting fifty-odd
//! call sites: `serve` opens the log file and points fd 1 and fd 2 at it. Nothing
//! in the daemon has to know it is being logged, and a panic message is captured
//! for free.
//!
//! **Why the file and not a pipe with a formatting thread.** Stamping each line
//! wants a pump thread between the daemon and the file, and the first version
//! here did that. It loses the lines that matter most: a daemon that fails during
//! startup exits before the pump is scheduled, and the error explaining why goes
//! down with the process — measured, not theorised. Worse, it makes every
//! `eprintln!` in the daemon that owns every PTY depend on a 64 KB pipe being
//! drained, and "a blocking write wedges the process" is the exact failure termio
//! already has a bug doc about. Writing straight to the file is synchronous in
//! the kernel: nothing is buffered in user space, so nothing is lost however the
//! process dies, and no writer can ever block on a reader.
//!
//! The cost is per-line timestamps, which need the call sites to change and so
//! belong with adopting `tracing` rather than with restoring the log at all.
//!
//! The daemon claims stderr only when it points at `/dev/null` — when the output
//! is provably going nowhere. Anything else means somebody chose that
//! destination: a terminal is a person watching, a pipe is a parent collecting
//! (`Command::output()` in the integration tests, a script reading the refusal
//! message), a file is a redirect the operator typed. Taking any of those over
//! would be a regression. "Not a terminal" was the first rule here and it was
//! too broad: it swallowed the piped case and broke a test that reads the
//! daemon's refusal off stderr.
