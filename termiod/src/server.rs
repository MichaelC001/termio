//! `termio server …` and `termio pair`: the client verbs that act on a
//! machine's daemon. They lived on `termiod` until the daemon was cut down to
//! `serve`; every verb a person or a control plane runs is `termio`'s now, the
//! way `docker` holds every verb and `dockerd` only runs.
//!
//! The sessions a daemon hosts are `termio session`'s, not this file's verbs:
//! `ls`, `create`, `attach`, `kill` and `send` stay here hidden, because
//! shipped apps and older clients run them on remote boxes, and both trees call
//! the functions at the bottom of this file.
//!
//! `--host` is the root's, so it reaches every verb, the way Rex's `--server`
//! does: `deploy` runs its loop from here, and every other command runs as the
//! same words on that machine over the user's own `ssh`.
