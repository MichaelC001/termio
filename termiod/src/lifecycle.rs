//! The daemon's lifecycle — install, update, repair — as one reconcile loop
//! (`docs/design/20260827-termiod-lifecycle-reconcile.md`).
//!
//! Two halves. The **node** half runs on the box, by whatever binary is on
//! disk: `status` reports what is there and `stop` asks the daemon to leave.
//! The **control-plane** half, `reconcile`, runs wherever the desired build
//! lives — the Mac, usually — against a [`Node`], and is the same function for
//! this machine and for a box over ssh; only the transport behind the trait
//! differs. Install is the loop from an empty box, update is the loop from a
//! stale one, and recovery from any failure is running it again.
//!
//! Nothing here needs a daemon that already knows about this module. The
//! daemon is found by the credential the kernel attaches to its socket, asked
//! what it holds with `list` (protocol v1), and stopped with `SIGTERM`, which
//! its drain path has always handled — so the first upgrade works the same as
//! every later one.
