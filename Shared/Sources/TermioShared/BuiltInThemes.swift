/// The built-in themes: 69 well-known Ghostty scheme names, in display order — 47
/// dark, then 22 light, by each theme's own background luminance.
///
/// Shared because the Mac's theme picker and the iPhone's offer the same set, and
/// two hand-kept copies would drift. Names only: both ends resolve them against
/// `GhosttyThemeCatalog` to render, and that meaning does not belong in this
/// package.
///
/// Curated, not exhaustive. No two *unrelated* entries read as the same theme —
/// measured as weighted mean CIE Lab distance over background, foreground, and
/// ANSI 1–6, with every cross-family pair clearing ΔE 11, which is what keeps a
/// scheme from arriving twice under two names (TokyoNight Night vs Storm 2.6).
/// The list's own tightest pair is Catppuccin Frappé against Nord at 11.3.
///
/// Flavors of one family are exempt because listing them is a deliberate act, not
/// an oversight: Catppuccin's three dark flavors sit at 4.3–8.6 of each other and
/// are still all here, since the flavor name is exactly what its users pick
/// between. `ThemeLibraryTests` enforces the resolve, the brightness split, and
/// the distance rule.
