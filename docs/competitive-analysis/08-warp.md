# Warp (alternative paradigm)

> AI-native **general-purpose terminal**, strong at the single-terminal agent
> experience; but no multi-agent session dashboard, and tied to an account/cloud.

## One-line positioning

A modern terminal written in Rust with its own GPU renderer, building AI
completions / agents directly into the terminal experience.

## Vendor / open source / links

- Vendor: Warp (commercial company). Site: https://www.warp.dev
- Closed-source; subscription (free tier + paid plans); requires account login.

## Core capabilities

- Block-based command history, AI command completion, a built-in agent that
  executes tasks inside the terminal.
- A highly polished single-terminal experience (custom renderer, workflows,
  team collaboration).

## Strengths

- Modern, fluid terminal fundamentals; deep AI completion/agent integration.
- Company scale and ecosystem far beyond indie tools.

## Weaknesses / relationship to Termio

- **No multi-agent session dashboard**: its core is "one great terminal + AI",
  not "orchestrate N agents in one place and watch their status".
- **Account + cloud required**: the exact opposite of Termio's "local-first,
  no account, no telemetry" — a hard selling point for Termio with
  privacy/intranet users.
- **Different paradigm**: Termio is more focused, lighter, more local; Warp is
  more general, heavier, more cloud.
- **Risk note**: if Warp ships a "multi-agent session dashboard + status" in
  its main product, the space for indie tools shrinks — Termio's hedge is
  precisely "native and lightweight + no account + not an IDE".

## Business model & funding

> Researched 2026-08-24. Warp is the only company in this landscape operating at
> real revenue scale, and the only one whose engine is visible.

- **Funding**: **~$73M** total — $23M Series A (2022-04, GV and Dylan Field),
  $50M Series B (2023-06, Sequoia). Seed angels include Sam Altman, Marc
  Benioff, Tobi Lütke. **No Series C found.**
- **Revenue**: never officially disclosed as a figure. What exists:
  - GetLatka estimates **$16M ARR for 2025** at 78 people — third-party, not
    confirmed.
  - Founder Zach Lloyd disclosed **rates, not levels**, in ~2025-08: revenue up
    **19× that year**, the first $1M ARR took 300+ days, then **$1M every ~10
    days and accelerating**. This is the only first-party claim.
  - Secondary 2026 reporting claims **$1M every 5–6 days**. Unconfirmed. Some of
    the same sources cite "700,000 paid developers", which cannot be reconciled
    with Warp's own "1M+ active developers" — treat that number as wrong.
- **The engine is Oz, not the terminal.** Oz launched **2026-02-10**: cloud
  orchestration for coding agents, hundreds in parallel, scheduled workflows,
  sandboxing the customer never builds. **Priced per agent run**; Warp Factories
  gives qualifying orgs up to $10K in early-access credits. Sacra's read:
  "revenue growth is driven primarily by AI consumption rather than seat-based
  licensing."

### vs. Termio

Warp is the proof that metered cloud agent compute is the fastest revenue engine
in this category — and it is precisely the engine Termio's non-negotiable #3
forbids. The consequence is structural and worth stating plainly in any funding
conversation: **Termio's revenue ramp is slower by design.** What it buys is the
one buyer Warp's model structurally cannot serve — anyone who will not put a
private repo on a vendor's machine. Do not pitch against Warp on growth rate;
pitch on the buyer Warp is excluded from.

Compare the two extremes of the same market: **Daytona** sold pure metered
sandbox compute and went 0 → $1M ARR in two months. **Ona** (ex-Gitpod) sold
environments and seats, took six years to ~$7M, and exited to OpenAI on
2026-06-11 — bought specifically so Codex could keep working for hours after the
laptop closes, which is Termio's own headline differentiator. The model vendors
are absorbing durable agent execution into their walled gardens; Termio's
counter is that a developer runs several agents and owns several machines, and
no vendor's garden covers that.

## Side note: other alternative paradigms

- **Cursor / VS Code + extensions**: IDE-built-in agents, diff/code-panel
  heavy — **the opposite philosophy to Termio**. Termio bets on "the agent
  already lives in the code; humans only need the conversation".
- **Ghostty / WezTerm / iTerm2**: general-purpose terminals — Termio's
  **foundation**, not competitors. Notably, **WezTerm's mux-server** is the
  best engineering reference for Termio's never-die host.
- **Plain tmux + hand-rolled worktrees**: the free DIY baseline, but no status
  dashboard, no at-a-glance overview, no brand polish — exactly the experience
  Termio aims to replace.
