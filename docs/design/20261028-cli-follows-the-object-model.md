# The CLI follows the object model

> Parse every `termio` command in one place, and name commands after the
> objects termiod owns. The help, the errors, the completions and the docs
> reference then come from that one parser.

## Decision

1. **One parser.** Every command is parsed by the clap tree in
   `termiod/src/bin/termio.rs`. This is already true of what ships: every
   app bundle carries that binary as `termio`. `scripts/termio` is only the
   fallback for a build made without the Rust toolchain, and it is deleted
   once those builds are not needed.
2. **Nouns first.** The grammar is `termio <noun> <verb>`. The nouns are the
   objects termiod already owns: session, pane, project, server. No noun
   exists only in the CLI.
3. **Four shortcuts.** `open`, `split`, `focus` and `zoom` stay at the top
   level. Each one is an alias of exactly one `<noun> <verb>`.
4. **One stream.** `termio events` streams every change the host publishes.
   Agent status is one event type in that stream. `session watch` becomes an
   alias of `events --type status`.
5. **The reference is generated.** The command reference on the docs site is
   built from the parser, the way the shortcut tables are built from
   `KeyCommandCatalog`. Prose pages stay hand-written.

Agent status stays the differentiator. `--wait` on `spawn`, `run` and `send`
blocks until an agent turn settles. Rex's `wait` blocks only until a block
ends. Nothing in this design changes `--wait`.

## Why

### The defects, as measured on 2026-10-29

These are the results of running the shipped client, `termio 0.67.0+2566`,
the binary the app installs at `/usr/local/bin/termio`:

| Command | Output | Defect |
|---|---|---|
| `termio bogus` | `termio: not a directory: bogus` | The `termio [DIR]` shortcut takes every typo as a path. |
| `termio whoami` | `termio: not a directory: whoami` | The command does not exist, and the error says so wrongly. |
| `termio skill` | `termio: not a directory: skill` | The command does not exist. The skill is installed only together with the hooks. |

`session --help`, `session bogus` and `agent install` are correct in the
shipped client. clap writes their help and errors.

A first draft of this doc listed six defects. It measured
`scripts/termio`, reached through a developer's symlink earlier on `PATH`,
not the shipped client. Measure the binary users run:
`file -L "$(command -v termio)"` must say Mach-O.

### What Rex does better

I read the help of the Rex CLI, build `g2db882`. I did not run its commands.

- **Named objects.** Rex has four nouns: `session`, `window`, `block`,
  `client`. Every verb acts on one of them.
- **Layout verbs.** `split`, `focus`, `zoom`, `move`, `swap`, `resize`.
  termio can place a pane only at creation, with `--direction` and
  `--ratio`.
- **General primitives.** `events` streams all server events. `api`
  inspects and calls the server API. `actions` lists what a client offers.
  termio adds a new verb for each new use case instead.
- **Self-description.** `whoami` prints the identity, the server, and where
  the caller runs. termio has no equivalent.

termio's own design already chose this model. `20261025-termiod-owns-the-view.md`
moved projects, groups, panes, focus and zoom into termiod. The CLI did not
follow. It can read the view with `termio view`. It cannot change it.

## The command tree

The status column says what exists on `origin/main` today.

| Command | Calls | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `termio session list \| new \| run \| send \| read \| close \| attach` | session ops | Exists. `new` is the current `spawn`. |
| `termio session focus <session>` | `pane.focus` on the session's pane | Exists on the app socket. Moves to the view op in phase 3. |
| `termio pane split \| focus \| zoom \| resize \| move \| close` | `pane_split`, `pane_focus`, `pane_zoom`, `split_resize`, `pane_move`, `pane_close` | Only `pane_close` exists. The rest is phase 2 of the view design. |
| `termio project list \| open \| remove` | `view`, `project_add`, `project_remove` | The ops exist. The CLI verbs do not. |
| `termio view [--json]` | `view` | Exists. |
| `termio events [--type <t,…>]` | the `ViewChanged` and status streams | New verb. `ViewChanged` exists. |
| `termio api list \| describe \| call` | the framed protocol | New. |
| `termio whoami` | `view`, only inside a termiod session | Done. |
| `termio skill show \| install \| uninstall` | the install request, with the hooks half left alone | Done. |
| `termio agent report \| install \| uninstall` | hook contract | Exists. `install` keeps the hooks. |
| `termio server status \| logs \| stop \| deploy \| tailscale` | `termiod` lifecycle | Exists. Already in clap. |
| `termio pair`, `termio notify`, `termio sim`, `termio version`, `termio completion` | unchanged | Exist. |

The shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Means |
|---|---|
| `termio open [DIR]` | `termio project open [DIR]` |
| `termio split [--right\|--down] [-- CMD]` | `termio pane split` beside `TERMIO_PANE` |
| `termio focus <pane>` | `termio pane focus <pane>` |
| `termio zoom [--off]` | `termio pane zoom` on `TERMIO_PANE` |

The bare form `termio DIR` stays, with one change. A word that does not exist
on disk and does not look like a path is an unknown command. clap's own error
reports it, with the closest command as a tip, and exits 2. A missing word that
looks like a path, such as `./app`, still reports a missing directory.

### `whoami`

`whoami` answers the first question an agent has inside a pane: where am I?
It prints these fields, and the same fields with `--json`:

- the session link, from `TERMIO_SESSION`
- the host session id, from `TERMIOD_SESSION_ID`
- the project, group and pane that hold that host session, from the view
- the host name, the channel, whether the app runs, and the daemon socket

It asks for the view only when the shell is a termiod session and the socket
accepts a connection. So it never starts a daemon. When a field is missing,
it prints `none`. It does not guess.

### `skill`

`agent install` installs two things: the status hooks and the `termio`
skill. They change at different rates. The skill changes with every CLI
release. The hooks change rarely. `termio skill install` writes only the
skill, and `termio skill uninstall` removes only the skill.

The skill text is compiled into the binary. `termio skill show` prints the
text this client carries. `install` asks the running termiod, which writes
the text *it* carries. The two match when both come from one install. A
termiod that is older than the client writes its own, older text.

Rex goes one step further. Its installed skill tells the agent to run `rex
skill show`, so the agent always reads the text of the installed `rex`. An
upgrade then updates every agent with no reinstall. termio should do the
same, because a stale installed skill is why the old names `sessions` and
`answer` must stay. The step is not taken yet. It changes the file the Mac
app writes and compares byte for byte, so it gets its own PR.

### `events`

`events` replaces the idea of one streaming verb per subject. The first
types are `status`, which is today's `watch`, and `view`, which is
`ViewChanged`. Each line in `--json` mode is one event object with a `type`
field. Later types are added without new verbs.

### `api`

`api list` prints the control ops that the host negotiated. `api describe
<op>` prints its fields. `api call <op> --json '<fields>'` sends one op and
prints the reply. This gives scripts the full protocol without a new verb
for each op. It also makes the protocol testable by hand.

## Rules for every command

- **One meaning per flag.** `--json`, `--wait` and `--timeout` behave the
  same on every verb that takes them. `--timeout` takes a duration, such as
  `30s` or `5m`. A plain number still means milliseconds for one release.
- **JSON is the contract.** Every command takes `--json`, including `server`
  and `version`. The shape is the protocol object, not a reformatted copy.
  Changes to it are additive only.
- **Exit codes stay as v3 and the docs set them.** `0` ok, `1` error, `2` a
  usage error, `3` timed out with the target still running. `watch` also exits
  `2` when the app closes its stream. That overlap is harmless: a usage error
  happens before any stream opens. Moving usage errors to `64` was considered
  and rejected, because `cli.mdx` publishes `2` as the contract.
- **Errors are one line plus one next step.** An unknown command prints the
  error and the closest command as a tip. It never prints the full usage.
- **Old names are hidden aliases.** `sessions`, `answer`, `spawn` and
  `watch` keep working. Help does not list them. They are removed when the
  installed skill no longer uses them, not before. Agents on users' machines
  run the skill they installed months ago.

## How help and docs are written

The CLI has three readers: a person at a shell, an agent that reads `--help`,
and a person on the docs site. All three read text that comes from the
parser.

**Help text.** Each command's help has four parts, in this order:

1. One sentence that says what the command does.
2. The usage line, which clap writes.
3. The flags, one line each.
4. One example.

A mechanism goes in the docs page, not in help. The current help for
`session send` explains trust gates in a paragraph. That paragraph moves to
`cli.mdx`, and the help keeps one example: `termio session send <s> t
--no-enter`.

**Help sentences** follow `VOICE.md`. One verb, present tense, no em dash,
no parentheses for a limit. Use "session", "pane", "project" and "host" with
the meanings in the view design, and no other words for them.

**The docs reference.** A hidden command, `termio __reference --json`, prints
the clap tree: every command, its one-sentence summary, its flags and its
example. `pnpm cli:sync` in `web/landing` writes it to a JSON file. The page
renders the reference from that file, the way `<Keybindings>` does.
`pnpm docs:check` fails when the file is older than the parser. Prose
sections of `cli.mdx`, such as the orchestration model and `--wait`, stay
hand-written and link into the reference.

## What we refuse

- **`termio config`.** The app's Settings window owns settings. A second
  writer for the same settings is a second source of truth.
- **A scripting language.** Rex runs Lua through `do`. `api call` plus
  `--json` gives scripts the same reach with no interpreter to ship.
- **`terminfo`, `keymap`, a login server.** Those belong to Rex's scope.
- **A flat list of 30 commands.** The top level holds the nouns, the four
  shortcuts and the utility commands. That is under 20 entries.

## Supersedes

CLI v3 said: "Nothing in the CLI ever names a window or pane." The view
design reversed the reason behind that rule, because layout is now host
state. This doc adds `pane` as a noun. The rest of v3 stands: links as
addresses, JSON as the contract, push instead of poll, and the exit codes.

## Phases

Each phase ships on its own.

1. **One parser.** Done for what ships. The typo fix for `termio [DIR]` is
   done. What is left: delete `scripts/termio` once no build needs a client
   made without Rust.
2. **`whoami` and `skill`.** Done. The skill stub that reads `termio skill
   show` is its own PR.
3. **`pane` and the shortcuts.** Ships with phase 2 of the view design,
   when `pane_split` and the other ops land in termiod.
4. **`events` and `api`.** `watch` becomes an alias.
5. **Generated reference.** `__reference`, `pnpm cli:sync`, and the check in
   `docs:check`.

## Risks

- **The hook contract.** Every agent hook calls `termio agent report` on
  every turn. No phase may change its flags, its output or its speed. The
  path that hooks call must not change: global agent configs never store a
  path derived from the app bundle.
- **Deleting the shell fallback.** A dev build made without the Rust
  toolchain has only `scripts/termio`. Deleting it leaves such a build with
  no CLI.
- **App-only verbs.** `session focus` and `session list` answer from the app
  when it runs, and from termiod when it does not. Any change to that routing
  is a separate PR.

## Open questions

- Should `session new` replace `session spawn` in help, or should `spawn`
  stay the canonical name? `spawn` is in every installed skill.
- Does `api call` need the write token, or only the read capabilities? The
  single-writer rule says observers never claim the write token.
- Should `events` cover hosts the caller reaches with `-H`, or only the local
  host in phase 4?
